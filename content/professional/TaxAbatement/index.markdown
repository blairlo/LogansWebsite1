On June 20, 2016 the Municipality of Anchorage (Municipality) put out a request for proposals (RFP)
for a fee-simple acquisition of a facility that meets the needs of the Municipality of Anchorage
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the redevelopment of the 825 L Street lot that
the DHHS facility currently occupies. In lieu of paying outright for a new DHHS facility, the Municipality
issued an RFP proposing a land trade using properties owned by the municipal land bank. Irwin
Development Group and Alaska Pacific Development partnered to create DHHS 1, LLC. (the Applicant)
and proposed a development plan for a new DHHS building, a new downtown senior center, and the
redevelopment of the Anchorage School District (ASD) bus facility currently located at Tudor and
Elmore Road. The application outlines development plans for a new DHHS facility and mixed use
development on the Tudor and Elmore site as well as a senior center on the 825 L Street lot.
The proposal presents a “deal” between the Applicant and the Municipality, in which the Applicant will
pay for and construct a new DHHS facility and redevelop the ASD bus facility at an alternative location,
in exchange for the deed to the existing DHHS facility, 16 acres at Tudor and Elmore where the bus
facility is currently located, various site and traffic improvements, and five years of property tax
abatement.

The Municipality contracted with Northern Economics, Inc. to evaluate the Applicant’s request for
property tax abatement with respect to financial feasibility, creation of employment, economic impacts,
public benefits, and economic development, specifically with respect to the requirements of Anchorage
Municipal Code (AMC) 12.35.010D. The following report summarizes the key findings for a more
comprehensive document that is available upon request from the Municipality.

This analysis assesses the Deal as described in the application received on June 14, 2017 and amended
on Sept 28, 2017.
