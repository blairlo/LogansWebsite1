I am a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at The University of Washington, and previously a consultant at the natural resource consulting firm Northern Economics. My research is broadly centered on incorporating climate change into public policy reform with two substantive focuses currently: building code institutions in the face of hurricanes, and aquatic invasive species management in the Pacific Northwest. My work transects the fields of economics, public administration, and physical geography, and often leverages remote sensing and machine learning techniques that you can read more about in my Research Section. Outside of work, you can find me hiking, biking, and camping in the Tucson mountains, or cooking (badly) in my trailer-mounted wood fired oven.
